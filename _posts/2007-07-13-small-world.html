<p>With my background, I couldn't help but be interested to read an article entitled <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/12/business/wbspot14.php">"Spotlight: Putting U.S. and British business skills to work in Germany"</a> from the IHT.</p>

<p>"[Paul Achleitner, CFO of Allianz] of Linz, Austria, [...] studied in Switzerland and at Grand Rapids Junior College in Michigan, earned a master's degree in business administration at Harvard and a doctorate in business and economics from the University of St. Gallen."</p>

<p>Austria!  GRCC!  No, I didn't attend GRCC but it's in my 'hood (if you consider the entire western side of Michigan a "hood.")</p>
