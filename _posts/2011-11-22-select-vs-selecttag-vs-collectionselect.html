Love the simple, rules-of-thumb write-up on which to use, when. <p /> "Use select when you require a basic drop-down selection box populated <br />with data not sourced from a database." <p /> "Use select_tag when you require a drop-down selection box populated <br />with data not sourced from a database, and are happy to hard code the <br />default selected option tag." <p /> "Use collection_select when you require a drop-down selection box, <br />whose source is a model/object." <p /> <a href="http://shiningthrough.co.uk/Select-helper-methods-in-Ruby-on-Rails">http://shiningthrough.co.uk/Select-helper-methods-in-Ruby-on-Rails</a>
