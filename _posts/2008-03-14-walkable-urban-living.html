<p>From <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2008/03/14/carollloyd.DTL&amp;feed=rss.surrealestate">Is Suburbia Turning Into Slumburbia?</a></p>

<p>"Now with high gas prices, long commutes, a bad job market and a new attraction to walkable urban living, it's just a matter of time before suburban fringes begin to absorb [...] people."</p>

<span> - Christopher Leinberger (The Option of Urbanism?)</span>

<p>"Indeed, the fact that Americans are embracing walkable neighborhoods is a good thing for their waistlines, their pocketbooks and the planet."</p>

<span> - John Norquist, former mayor of Milwaukee, WI</span>
