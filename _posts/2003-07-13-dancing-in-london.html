There we were, at the World Famous English Dance Club (names withheld to protect the innocent,) where I had just paid 15 &pound; ($22) to get in and the girls had paid nothing because it was Ladies Night, when we were stuck listening to R. Kelley, Beyonce/Jay Z, and the like.&nbsp; Damn, we had been sucked into RnB niqht.&nbsp; Here I came all this way, stoked to get into the <a href="http://www.ministryofsound.com">WFEDC</a> (World Famous English Dance Club) to hear some amazing British Dance/House/Trance/D&amp;B/whatever and we got was the same stuff I could have listened to at TLMM (The Local Meat Market) back in Chapel Hill.&nbsp; Oh well, the people were more stylish anyway...
