<p>In a way, I have HotJobs to thank for getting into Yahoo. It&rsquo;s on HotJobs where I first saw the job that eventually became mine (I actually found a couple of jobs there that I applied and interviewed for&hellip;) Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to try something against the HotJobs API for a while now so I sat about doing so in Python.</p>

<p><em>TASK:</em> Create a simple script that takes two arguments, a job title and a zip code, and then query HotJobs for resumes containing that job title near the zip code. After retrieving the resumes, output a list of job titles representing the *next* jobs people held after holding the job title passed in the query.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Web services license key registration process is not instantaneous, so shortly after I got these steps in place&hellip;</p>

   <li>Hello world in Python. <a href="http://python.about.com/od/gettingstarted/ss/helloworld_2.htm" target="_new">Check.</a>

   <li>POST Web service calls in Python. Hey! <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/python/python-rest.html#post" target="_new">Check!</a>

</ol>

<p>&hellip; I started getting <code>IOError: ('http error', 401, 'Authorization Required', )</code> so I realized I probably needed to put in for a Web services license key. Looks like they&rsquo;ll be getting back to me.</p>

<p>Notes (so-far) on Python:</p>
