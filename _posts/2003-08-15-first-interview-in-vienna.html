Had my first interview in Vienna today.&nbsp; It's funny; I guess it's business and all and maybe I was expecting too much special treatment but how much more personality-free can an interviewer get?&nbsp; I mean, here I've been in contact with the guy for two months and I've put all this time and energy into translating my resume (ahem, "CV") into German as well as learning German in the first place and moving to Vienna and all he can do me the favor of doing is a cursory greeting at the beginning and never breaking a smile during the interview?&nbsp; Cold.
