<p>I'm finishing up my second round of <a href="http://www.timeoutservices.com/bootcamp/community_boot_camp.aspx">Bootcamp</a> at work and have no hesitation recommending it (disclaimer:  I get nothing for my endorsement.)  </p>

<p>It's a great mix of cardio and strength training.  It actually reminds me of PE class from school, but in a good way.  Now I'm old enough to understand the benefits.</p>
