<p>I thought "<a href="http://yuiblog.com/miraglia/ajaxworld.zip">JavaScript Libraries in the World of AJAX</a>" would be more of an overview of different libraries but it was conducted at a higher level of abstraction.  </p>

<p>One of the points was a <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=1041101">Joseph Smarr Redux</a>: "blank pages are slow."</p>

<p>It didn't strike me the first time I heard him say it but this time I stopped to reflect on each page's size as it fits into a workflow.  Easy to contemplate in afterthought, difficult to address in implementation as a design constraint (while also creating dynamic user experiences.)</p>

<p>Speaking of JavaScript libraries, where's <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">scriptaculous</a>?  I thought they'd be here...</p>
