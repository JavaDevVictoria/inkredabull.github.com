  Please excuse the mess while I update my blog; I'm "cleaning house" as I port to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. Images might be off in terms of size, there aren't any post titles or tags, styling isn't the way I want it, etc.
</p>

<p>
  A while back, I wanted to move from WordPress to something more Ruby-friendly.  I looked at <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com/" target="_blank">Mephisto</a>, 
  <a href="http://radiantcms.org/" target="_blank">RadiantCMS</a>, and Jekyll and ulitmately decided on Jekyll given its level of maturity, 
  the fact that Github's behind it, and because it provided decent migrations tools.
</p>

<p>
There are a few reasons I'm moving the blog:
<ul>
  <li>
    The Bull Og previously ran under WordPress.  About two years ago, I discovered Posterous and fell in love with their service. While I was happy for the team 
    when I <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/big-news">heard the new of their acquisition</a>, I decided I wanted to be more in control of my content. 
  </li>
  <li>
    I'd like to have a Content Management System (in Ruby) for a couple of different things: namely photos, portfolio, and a blog.
  </li>
  <li>
    I want to force myself to learn some of the technologies being used in Jekyll, namely Markdown.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  In the course of the migration, I've made use of <a href="https://github.com/pepijndevos/jekyll/blob/patch-1/lib/jekyll/migrators/posterous.rb" target="_blank">this Posterous-to-Jekyll tool</a>.
  The script itself is dead simple to use and works like a charm, but it won't help you getting your blog up when you don't know a thing about Jekyll (blogpost potential of my learnings? indeed...)
</p>

<p>
As you might notice, there's no way to comment here. There's two reasons for that: 
  <ol>
    <li>I don't know if you can with Jekyll</li>
    <li>Even if you can, I don't think I'll enable commenting; I'd rather not spend time "weeding the garden." This blog is more of a way to document for posterity than it is an interactive medium.  Twitter/Facebook/etc. are the publishing channels where interaction is encouraged.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
BTW, I owe a debt of gratitude to Alex Payne for providing a framework to get started from in terms of having a Jekyll blog.  If you're handy with git, are interested in using Jekyll, and can read the (fairly simple) 
Jekyll <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/usage" target="_blank">How-To</a>, do yourself a favor and git clone <a href="https://github.com/al3x/al3x.github.com" target="_blank">Alex's blog</a> as a "Hello World" 
experience; you'll be up-and-running and hands-on with Jekyll in no time.
