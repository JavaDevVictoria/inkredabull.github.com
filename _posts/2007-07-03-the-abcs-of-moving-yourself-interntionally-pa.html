<p>Only two more weeks until my wife arrives in the States.  I'm excited and nervous.</p>

<p>Nervous because of the many things that there still seem to be to do in preparation.  Just yesterday I realized that the company moving our stuff (read:  luggage) won't be insuring the contents.  </p>

<p>Since it's luggage, there's a different set of rules.  Now I have to find a insurance company willing to sell me a policy to cover the contents from Vienna to San Francisco.</p>      

<p>UPDATE:  I found an insurance policy to cover There's nothing like an insurance policy (or release forms for surgery) in a foreign language to see how good you really are. </p>

<p>(Sorry it's not text.  I tried copying-and-pasting out of Acrobat Reader and got a bunch of gibberish.  Does v8.0 encode the Unicode to prevent you from doing such?)</p>
