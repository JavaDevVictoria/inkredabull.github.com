A long time ago in a Midwestern state fair away, there once was a boy who loved to play video games.  That boy would spend hours and hours in front of - first - an Atari, then the Commodore 64, then a Nintendo along with a 386 PC (although not at the same time) and finally, a Sega.  He never dreamed that one day, all kinds of boys and girls from around the world who did the same kind of thing would grow older and end up in the same place at the same time to celebrate the video game industry.

Today, I picked up my pass for the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developers' Conference 2007</a> starting tomorrow and running the rest of the week.   One of the "tracks" I'll be attending is the collection of sessions on mobile gaming.  I think that there's huge potential for mobile technologies (and web development!) in the next 3-5 years.
