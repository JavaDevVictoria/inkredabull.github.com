<article class="post">
<p>There was a point today, sometime in-between the deluge of new-hire paperwork, getting to know a new office-space, having to configure a new Microsoft system because my Macbook Pro hasn't yet arrived, the multitude of new names, and a code overview for (just one) part (of many) of an intricate Rails system, when I thought: "this is exactly what I was looking for."</p>

<p>Today ranks as one of the best first days I've had since starting as a software engineer.  I like the people I'll be working with, I like the company, I like the product, and I like the numerous challenges before me.</p>

<p>Although, I'll admit that I didn't sleep very well last night.  It was mostly due to the heat in San Francisco but partially due to one nightmare I had about showing up unprepared.  I don't exactly remember what happened in the dream; I either wore shorts or didn't have any pants on when walking into the office.  One is certainly worse than the other, but considering the magnitude of change from my previous position, only one (fairly harmless) nightmare is doing pretty well for the night before a new job.</p>  

<p>There was, however, a funny moment at lunch today. The question came up: "so how did someone from Yahoo! get a job at a rails shop?" (alluding to the fact that Yahoo! is primarily a PHP shop.)  It reminded me of the time just over three years ago when I caught the Yahoo! shuttle bus back into San Francisco after a day of interviewing in Sunnyvale (which ultimately resulted in my first job at Yahoo!.)</p>

<p>On the shuttle, I started chit-chatting with the guy next to me.  He asked if I had snagged the interview through a friend or relative and when I responded that I had landed it after an application through <a href="http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/" target="_new">HotJobs</a>, he jolted a bit and responded, rather surprised: "you must have some pretty special skills, then..."</p>

<p>Special enough, I guess...</p>
