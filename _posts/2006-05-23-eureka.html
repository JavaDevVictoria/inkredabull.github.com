I was reading <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2006/05/dont-regulate-my-common-sense/">this post</a> when I realized that I had no idea what rel="follow" means. So I looked it up of course and I found <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/elemental-microformat">this</a> and I'll admit, it took some time before it sank in (reading the explanations of RelNoFollow and RelTag reminded me of my undergrad math texts...) but now I get it! A tag space!!! The Semantic Web for HTML!!! Brilliance!!!
