<p>Several months ago, my brother came to town.  He wanted a good steak dinner so we went to one of the best steakhouses in town.</p>

<p>Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we sat at the bar for a drink. When it was time to be seated we made our way into the dining room but as we were leaving the lounge area, a trio of jazz musicians were setting up.  As I was leaving, I noticed and immediately recognized the drummer: <a href="http://www.petermagadini.com/" target="_new">Peter Magadini</a> of polyrhythm fame.  Unbelievable after all these years; Peter was setting up to play in the steakhouse where we were about to have dinner!</p>

<p>The trio played a set and when they took a break, I rushed up to greet Peter and tell him my story of having <a href="/?p=310" target="_new">met him years previously</a>.  What a rush to meet a musician I so admire in a steakhouse in SF.</p>

<p>And yes, the steaks were fantastic. The best I've ever had, actually.</p>
