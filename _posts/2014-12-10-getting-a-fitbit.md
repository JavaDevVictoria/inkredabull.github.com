## Getting a Fitbit

Back in 2006, my wife came up with an idea for her Master's thesis
around the concept of a [gamified
pedometer](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1125797) and "tackled the
challenge of motivating people \[...\] to exercise more \[using\] a
device which encourages physical activity of its users in an
entertaining way and reinforces positive exercise habits." Here I am in 2014; considering getting a Fitbit (a little pre-Christmas gift to myself?) 

Which one should I get?

### Making a Choice

As I scan the [Fitbit website](http://www.fitbit.com/compare), it's obivous I need to figure out what my main Use Case is going to be.  

Checking out the [Charge HR](http://www.fitbit.com/chargehr), I'm reminded of a time years ago when I used something
very similar: my Timex Ironman Triathlon heart-rate monitor!  Wondering where it was, I dug around in my belongings and sure
enough, I found it (albeit dusty):

Wow; not sure how long ago I got that. I think I was living in
Vienna, so it's at least eight years old. I could have sworn I got it
shipped to me via Amazon but I don't see it listed anywhere in my
last 12 years (12!) of order history with them, so I must have
picked it up there at some brick-and-mortar store.

Anyways, the Charge HR isn't even available yet and judging by how much dust the Timex has collected in the last five years, maybe that's not the best model for me right now.

The [Surge](http://www.fitbit.com/surge) looks like it does everything under the sun.  "Music Control" - very intriguing.  One
problem; also not yet available.

While comparing the wearable models, I came across the
[Aria](http://www.fitbit.com/aria) and wonder how it compares with the
[Withings scale](http://www.withings.com/us/smart-body-analyzer.html). I bet the value-add is how well it integrates within the Fitbit ecosystem.

I'm a little hesitant to even consider any of the timepiece models as a replacement for the [beautiful
watch](http://www.skagen.com/us/en/products/grenen-mens-steel-mesh-and-titanium-case-watch-pdp233lttmp.html)
my wife got me for my birthday years ago, so that rules out the
Charge, Charge HR, and the Surge and really only leaves the Zip,
One, and Flex.

I've been waking up fairly early recently so I definitely think it would be helpful to have a model that tracks my sleep habits, eliminating the Zip.

### Conclusion

Between the One and the Flex, I think I'm going to go with the [One](http://www.fitbit.com/one).  I really don't want to wear a second item on my wrist in addition to my watch so the One it is.
