One of my best tips in Austria in Loipersdorf.  I try to convince anybody I think would like it to go.  It's a great wellness experience and only a few hours from Vienna.

The problem is, when I do some research in order to pass along links to help "sell" the place, I rarely find well-designed websites to do so.  

For all of my friends and acquaintances who aren't familiar with the Austrian wellness scene, here's some advice to Austrian businesses in general and tourist locations in specific:

<ol>
<li>Emphasize pictures of main attractions</li>
<li>Improve the quality of content in English</li>
</ol>

It's not just the native language English-speaking expat community who might be interested!  This advice is applicable towards all potential consumer populations (read:  neighboring countries) whose second language is English.
