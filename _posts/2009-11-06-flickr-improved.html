<p>I created a Flickr account a long time ago.  I then created a Yahoo account and tied that to my Flickr account.  I then created another Yahoo account and wanted to replace my previous Yahoo account with the new one but couldn't do it! </p>

<p>I just discovered that I could swap out my old Yahoo handle with my new one and tie my Flickr account to the Yahoo account I use most.  Nicely done, Flickr.</p>
