<p>Everything was going smoothly with Firefox.  I was using innerHTML and the new arguments that I shoved into the DOM were getting posted to the server, no problem.  Then, I switched over to IE to test and discovered that the newly created arguments weren't showing up. Figuring it was a problem with IE, I inspected the DOM (by inserting a "return false;" statement in the form validator function. </p>

<p>Sure enough, the newly-created arguments were not getting appended to the DOM and therefore not posted to the server.  I tried shoving the new arguments into the DOM but wound up getting this message:</p>

<code>Node cannot be inserted at the specified point in the hierarchy</code>

<p>Here's what I was trying to do (intentional space at beginning of input to prevent WordPress rendering as HTML):</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>newCell = '';
        
        var row = document.getElementById('my_table').getElementsByTagName('tr').childNodes[2];
        
        row.childNodes[i].innerHTML = newCell;</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Figuring that the string-based method of creating an element was getting me anywhere, I tried to dynamically create and append the node:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>cellContent = row.childNodes[i].innerHTML;

        var inputNode = document.createElement(&quot;input&quot;); 

        inputNode.setAttribute('type', 'text');

        inputNode.setAttribute('id', 'my_new_input');
        inputNode.setAttribute('name', 'my_new_input');

        inputNode.setAttribute('value', cellContent);
        inputNode.setAttribute('class', row.childNodes[i].className);        
                                
        row.childNodes[i].replaceChild(inputNode, row.childNodes[i].firstChild);</pre></div>
</div>
