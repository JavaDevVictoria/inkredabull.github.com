<p>I&#8217;ve seen this error a number of times:</p>

<p><code>Cannot perform operations on a Metamorph that is not in the DOM</code></p>

<p>&#8230; and I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;ve not known exactly what a Metamorph is but for the most part, I can usually remember whatever it was that I just did that caused the error, undo, and find a different way.</p>

<p>Today, the thought crossed my mind: &#8220;What <em>is</em> a Metamorph?&#8221; and that&#8217;s when I went digging.</p>

<p>I knew from having seen the &#8220;metamorph-#-start/end&#8221; references in script tags that it was part of the magic that makes Ember.js bindings work, but I didn&#8217;t know exactly where it came from.</p>

<p>Suprisingly, I couldn&#8217;t find any search results answering the question. It was only after digging through some stackoverflow answers that my curiosity was satisfied when I found <a href='https://github.com/tomhuda/metamorph.js/'>this</a>.</p>
