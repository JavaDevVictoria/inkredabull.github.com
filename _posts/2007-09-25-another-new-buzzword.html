<p>I'm impressed with Laszlo/OpenLaszlo but by the time you teach engineers the required markup and corresponding  attributes to render forms correctly, why not just teach them CSS?  I know the answer to my own question (portability) but as I sat in a session for hands-on exposure to OpenLaszlo, I couldn't help but marvel at the amount of syntax one would have to know in order to implement a non-trivial application.  It looks like 
ColdFusion.</p>

<p>That having been said, a Laszlo representative did a demo for at their Laszlo booth.  Did you know that <a href="http://click-shirt.com/">Click-Shirt</a> is powered by OpenLaslzo?  Slick interface!!!</p>

<p>And, they used (maybe even coined?) today's second new buzzword of the day:</p>

<dl>
   <dt>Webtop</dt>
   <dd>A modular way to deploy multiple RIA/AJAX applications</dd>
</dl>
