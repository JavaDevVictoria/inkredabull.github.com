<p>Today, I saw lots of tools for <em>risk-free</em> deployment of the latest dynamic user experiences (e.g. using AJAX.)  </p>

<p>Didn't find a mind-blowing Open-Source JS graphing library, but who has?</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exposure to SOA infrastructure for RIAs</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons</p>

<ul>

<li>In a conference about AJAX, wouldn't you think you'd see more hotshots showing off their tricks with Firefox?</li>

<li>In only one session was authentication mentioned.  When the speaker asked if anyone had worked with authentication, it looked like I was the only one with my hand raised.   Why haven't I heard anything about OpenID today?</li>

<li>I heard someone today talk about a particular feature working across all "AJAX runtimes."  What?!?</li>

</ul>
