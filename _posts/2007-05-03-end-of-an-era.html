<p>Or "Goodbye Palm, it's been nice knowing you."</p>

<p>Palm (or "PalmOne" or "Palm Inc." or whatever they're called today) has lost another loyal customer.</p>

<p>I had been thinking about upgrading my PDA for a while now.  Yes, I know most of your are laughing at me because...</p>

<ol>
  <li>I'm not using a Crackberry</li>
  <li>smartphones have been "in" for so long now </li>
</ol>

<p>
...but you see, I made the most of that investment.  I work hard for my money and even though I'm a gadget geek, I don't like them enough to have to part with my hard-earned cash <a href="http://www.thebullog.net/?p=8">every eight months.</a>  
</p>

<p>
None of the Palm devices I've looked at recently have built-in wireless capabilities meaning that if I want Internet, I have to pay to connect to it.  With ubiquitous computing on the horizon enabled by wifi everywhere, what kind of sense does it make to buy that kind of device?
</p>

<p>And, after having so many integration problems ever since I bought the PDA, I've think I'll be using a new system.  Paper.  Pen.  No upgrade/integration/versioning issues.  </p>

<p>How much of my life have I wasted getting Hotsync/Outlook/FranklinCovey/more to play together?  I need to plan my day, not use my day to plan.</p>
