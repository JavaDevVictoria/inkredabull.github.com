<p>Yesterday was my final day after just over three years with Yahoo! and while I was sad to say goodbye to the many talented professionals I met there, I'm excited to embark on a new adventure.  I'll be fulfilling the other half of a dream to live <em>*AND*</em> work in San Francisco at a startup whose service you're sure to hear about if you haven't already.  

</p><p>I've been looking for a good fit at a small(-ish) Rails shop where I would be able to concentrate on the frontend (read: tons of JavaScript/HTML/CSS) for a customer-facing site; a place with growth potential where I could make a substantial impact, a place where they would value my years of experience in the backend in addition to my UI chops, a place where I could utilize my soft skills, a place where I could teach and learn, a place where I could potentially contribute back to the Rails community.</p>

<p>As of next week, I'll be joining the company making personalized shopping effortless - <a href="http://shopittome.com/" target="_new">Shop It To Me</a> - as Senior Web Developer.  If I have your contact info, get ready for an invite to join!</p>
