<p>Check out <a href="http://cobb.stanford.edu/courses/cs547/090417/090417-cs547-300.wmv">this presentation</a> by Alex Payne on the Twitter API.</p>

<p>The reason I've chosen to share it is because of a little insight I had, assisted by a question from the audience.  Pay particular attention to what Prof. Winograd says towards the end (paraphrased) about inanimate objects being able to tweet and what that could mean for the scalability of Twitter.</p>

<p>If the Internet is the operating system, I think Twitter will be its message queue.</p>
