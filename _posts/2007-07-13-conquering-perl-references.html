<p>What a headache Perl de-referencing can be, which I had forgotten ('cause it's been a while since I've worked with such nested data structures.)</p>

<p>I had this variable:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$obj-&gt;{'children'}</pre></div>
</div>


<p>...giving me some big data structure of a hierarchy of the object's children.  When I dumped the variable to STDERR, I could tell that there was an 'id' associative index in there somewhere.</p>

<p>After a great deal of trial-and-error, I finally came up with this in order to dereference the referenced arrays in $obj-&gt;{'children'} and then get the "id" value of the referenced hash.  Say that fives times fast.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>foreach my $child ($obj-&gt;{'children'}) {
           print STDERR @$child[1]-&gt;{'id'}.&quot;\n&quot;;
   }</pre></div>
</div>
