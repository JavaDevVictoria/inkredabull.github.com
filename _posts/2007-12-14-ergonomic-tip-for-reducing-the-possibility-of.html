<p>Earlier this week, an ergonomic specialist had an interesting suggestion to help relieve some pressure in my wrist.  She suggested placing velcro on the keys of the keyboard for tactile awareness.</p>

<p>In high school, I had a wickedly disciplined teacher for typing.  He was unforgiving when it came to mistakes which, at the time, seemed extreme.  Now, I'm thankful for the fact that he was so strict because I know where my hands are on the keyboard without having to look.</p>

<p>The difference is that now I'm starting to use my index and middle fingers for some keys for which I was using my pinky before to relieve stress in my wrist.  The velcro on keys helps me locate "home."</p>
