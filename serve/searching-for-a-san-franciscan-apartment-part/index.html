<p>Yesterday's strategy was a bit old skool.</p>

<p>In summary, I walked up and down streets in Russian Hill looking for "For Rent" signs.  I walked up on one street, went over a block, came down the parallel street, went over another block, and repeated.  </p>

<p>I canvassed about seven streets in total at about four blocks long each.  I got a couple of numbers that way, even for the apartment that I think I'll sign the lease on.</p>
