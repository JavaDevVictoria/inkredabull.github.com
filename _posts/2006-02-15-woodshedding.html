I was thinking the other day how similar software engineering and music are with respect to practice.&nbsp; I mean, I used to "woodshed"&nbsp;when I played drums and now I have to&nbsp;"woodshed" in order to "keep up my chops"&nbsp;in IT.&nbsp; I like the analogy because when I was practicing drums, I knew I was getting better, just like now when I spend so many hours in front of the computer to get code to work.&nbsp; Instead of improving my time in 5/4 ala Joe Morello or dreaming of pulling off a solo like Neil Peart, I'm mastering web technologies.&nbsp; So similar, so different.
