<p>I was in a presentation on building RIAs with OpenLaszlo by <a href="http://secretartofscience.com/blog/">this guy</a> when I finally got it. </p>

<p>We was demonstrating a pretty basic Hello World-like app and it wasn't until the end when I had my epiphany.   With about five minutes left in the presentation, he switched the output of OpenLaszlo from Flash to DHTML and the DHTML interface looked <strong>*almost exactly the same*</strong> as the Flash UI.  Woah.</p>
