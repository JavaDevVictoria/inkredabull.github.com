<p>Now that I've been successful finding an apartment in the city, here's a summary of my tips.</p>

<ol>

<li>
<b>Walk the beat</b> <br />  Walk around the neighborhood(s) looking for "For Rent" signs.  I found my apartment when I called one of those numbers and the place had just come available that same day!  I was the first one to see it and the first one to apply, hence the first one to get it.</li>

<li>
<b>Read justinsonmnia's advice</b><br />  Once again (in case you weren't paying attention in part I,) check out <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2006/07/how-to-find-an-apartment-in-san-francisco/">this.</a>  Try reading it before starting your search, not during.</li>

<li>
<b>Avoid open houses.</b><br />  Once you've read justinsomnia's tips, do yourself a favor, don't get caught up in that mayhem.  I did it one Saturday and that was enough to bring back <a href="http://www.thebullog.net/?p=30">some unpleasant (and strangely similar) memories</a> of apartment hunting in Vienna.  Take a week off if necessary to schedule appointments during normal business hours, Monday through Friday.</li>

<li>
<b>craigslist</b><br /> Duh.  But everybody else is using it too...

</li>
