So, I heard an interview with Missy Elliott recently and I thought, "Hmm....&nbsp; She sounds interesting.&nbsp; I've only heard 'Pass That Dutch' and it's a catchy tune but I can't say that I know any other songs by her."

What did I do?&nbsp; I turned to iTunes.&nbsp; I found the 'This is Not a Test' album and decided I would give it a try, using an American bank for payment.&nbsp; To make a long story short, you can't do that in iTunes.&nbsp; If you live in Austria, you have to have a financial instituation in Austria for the payment.&nbsp; It's not even about the billing address.&nbsp;

Sorry Missy, I can't buy your music.
