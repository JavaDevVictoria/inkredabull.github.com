Why is it that I should have the most amazing idea for a composition for my wedding two weeks before the big day?!?&nbsp; Sure, I could brush up on Finale and take a stab at doing my own arrangement but I only have two weeks and it's not like I don't have other stuff to be doing.&nbsp; Persian Daf with Lohengrin.&nbsp; Better yet, throw in some Coltrane!!!&nbsp; Learn Sibelius in two weeks time?&nbsp; Are you kidding?!?&nbsp; There's no way I'm going to get it done.&nbsp; I think <a href="http://www.performingartsschools.com/interviews/janus.html">my boy</a>'s going to come to my rescue.&nbsp;
