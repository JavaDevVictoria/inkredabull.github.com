<p>I have two legacy apps in Perl which need to be integrated; one was written adhering fairly strictly to OO design, the other using an MVC framework (can't tell quite yet how well the code sticks to MVC principles though.)  On the horizion, I know there's another Perl app coming my way for integration; not sure of its architecture.</p>

<p>Do I continue developing in Perl using MVC (trying to force square pegs into round holes where necessary,) or do I migrate more and more code into Javascript given the desire to realize new functionality via an RIA?</p>
