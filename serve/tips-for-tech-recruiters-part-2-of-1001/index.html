<p><em>"...am reaching out to you to see if you would be interested in finding out more about this great opportunity.... this is a fabulous company, very stable and is probably just as exciting, if not more than Yahoo." </em></p>

<p>More exciting than Yahoo?  Have you been reading the news lately?  I can guarantee you, there are few other workplaces right now that are as exciting as Yahoo.</p>    

<p><em>"... We need to hire 15-20 people (contractors)... There is a chance this will go full-time down the road."</em></p>

<p>Wait a minute, I thought you said this was "very stable"?  Since when can you use "very stable" and "contractor" in the same paragraph?</p>
