For Christmas, I got a National Geographic subscription as a gift.  I'm trying to be a better citizen of the world and learn more about its geography and people.  

When I read a story like <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/10/africa/web.0110somalia.php">this one</a>, I want a link to Ras Kamboni on Google Maps to see where it is.  Sure, I'll go look it up myself (depending on how much time I have) but why not make it easier for users?  

Same goes for financial data.  If I read a story about the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">new iPhone</a>, can't I get Apple's financials alongside the story?
