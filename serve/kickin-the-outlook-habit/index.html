<article class="post">
<p>Recently, I switched to a Mac and started using Entourage because the two things about Outlook that were hardest to give up were #1) the ability to setup meetings via Exchange and #2) management of my contacts.  </p>

<p>A co-worker turned me onto Thunderbird (with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/">Lightning</a>) in a bid to help me break my Outlook addiction.  I've used Outlook for so long it's hard to quit.  I...</p>

<ul>
<li>...love the ability to drag an email onto the calendar and create an event</li>
<li>...know the keyboard shortcuts for creating my most-used items (tasks, notes, emails, etc.) </li>
<li>...found this <a href="http://www.taskline.com/default">great plugin</a> for automatically scheduling tasks as a part project management</li>
<li>...used the journal for all kinds of things including my job search two years ago, and ... </li>
<li>...had the views of my different items (most notably tasks) tweaked to work for me</li>  
</ul>

<p>Outlook makes it so easy, but I can do away with MS PIMs apps on all OSes now that I can do calendar management with Yahoo Calendar (beta) and contact management with <a href="http://plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a>.  </p>

<p>Here's how to do it in five easy steps:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Before you begin, choose a color</strong></li>

<p>You're about to create three calendars which will remain in sync:  one in Thunderbird, one in Calgoo, and one in Yahoo.</p>

<p>I recommend choosing a single color to identify your calendar across all three tools.  I set forth on this exercise to make my "Work" calendar available and I chose red.</p>   

<p>You're likely to repeat these steps for calendars serving different purposes in the future so this is more a recommendation than a must-do but using color will help remind you which calendar you're looking at.</p> 

<li><strong>Get yourself a Calgoo Hub account</strong></li>

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.calgoo.com/hub/index.do">Calgoo Hub</a> and sign up.  It's easy.</p>

<li><strong>Publish your calendar to Calgoo</strong></li>

<p>Follow <a href="http://www.calgoo.com/hub/howto_caldav.do#sunbird">these instructions</a> provided by Calgoo to (create and) publish your calendar from "Sunbird" (the basis of the Lighning calendar which is Mozilla-based.)</p>

<p>At this point, you can also change the color of the calendar in both Thunderbird and Calgoo.</p>

<p>I recommend change settings in Calgoo on the calendar to make it private.  Use that URL for the next step.</p>  

<li><strong>Subscribe to the Calgoo in Yahoo Calendar</strong></li>

<p>You have to be able to use the Yahoo Calendar beta at <a href="http://beta.calendar.yahoo.com">http://beta.calendar.yahoo.com</a>.  </p>
<p>Subscribe to the Calgoo calendar using the URL from the previous step and choose your color for the calendar.</p>

<li><strong>Check your Yahoo Calendar</strong></li>

<p>There it is!  Your Thunderbird calendar! In Yahoo!</p>

</ol>

<p>As easy as that, I no longer need Outlook to manage my contacts and calendars.</p>

<p>Thanks to Arun for suggesting that I check out Lightning.</p>

<p>(I see a <a href="http://www.taskline.com/default.asp">Taskline</a>-like plugin for Lightning in the future.  Taskline, get on that.  Hmmm...  I see a plugin for Bugzilla tasks in the future...)</p> 

<p><b>2009-01-14 UPDATE:</b> Or, instead of the multistep process, you can make it easy on yourself by just trying <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/calendar/yahoocalendar/sync/sync-05.html">this</a>, though I did have some difficulties getting it to work (Error Console was saying the calendar was either not DAV or not available.)  After a couple of times of adding and deleting calendars, and of shutting down Thunderbird and restarting it, my Yahoo calendar finally appeared in Thunderbird.  Cookie issue?</p>
