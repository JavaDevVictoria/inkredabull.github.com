<p>What does Web 2.0 mean for the Enterprise?  Hearing Ted Farrell of Oracle speak about the design challenges got me thinking. One of my biggest gripes about using apps on the open web is that I don't control my data (well, in most cases.)</p>  

<p>Do you use an RSS aggregator that exposes your newsfeeds for export?  How about an online addressbook that lets you allow <strong>export</strong> your contacts?  On the Internet, it's a choice (that's the great thing; there are alternatives) but in an enterprise environment, there are numerous reasons (security being one of them) why the organization needs to control their users' information.</p>

<p>Even still, given the advances in web GUIs, there's a need to expose more information internally in large organiztaions and reuse it in a dynamic fashion.</p>
