From a LinkedIn InMail today:

"Returning Indians can explore Tech Positions at [Well-known Internet Company.]   This is an Opportunity for all the Indian Techies to relocate to homeland and get back to the roots. With the Indian Economy revved up, time has changed. Now you can move to India and explore the&nbsp;same Technology and work as in US."

If I've been a software engineer in the south bay, that must mean that I'm Indian. &nbsp;Of course, with my name, I could easily be mistaken for someone from Bangalore, or Mumbai.
