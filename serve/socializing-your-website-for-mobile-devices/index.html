<p>There's a great movie coming to town as part of a film festival. I've been telling some cousins that they have to see this film; I was going to even buy the DVD for them but it's not available.   I went to the film festival's website and found the film.  Great! Alright, now how do I send a link to this page (am on an iPhone.)  Let's see... "Email this to a friend"?  Nope.  Copy and paste the URL? No, I'm on an iPhone, can't.  Reddit? Delicious? StumbleUpon? Anything?  No. No. No.  And no.</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind when designing for today.</p>

<p>By the way, the movie is "Exile Family Movie" and it's coming to the Tiburon International Film Festival.  Why don't I include a link?  Because I'm moblogging.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Here's the <a href="http://www.tiburonfilmfestival.com/filmInfo.php?film_id=5565">link</a> for the movie (updated via a normal browser.)</p>

<p>UPDATE #2:  I just figured out how to send a link to a friend using Safari.</p>
