<p>How often do you go to a restaurant and the waiter/waitress brings you a glass of water with ice in it?  How often are you so hot that you really need ice water to cool you down?</p>

<p>Here in San Francisco, I've been in air-conditioned restaurants in the winter where they're served ice-water. Since returning to the States from Austria three years ago (where it is uncommon to serve ice in water at restaurants,) I almost always ask for 'water, no ice' at the beginning of a meal.  Surprisingly, several waiters or waitresses have asked me why and ice water is simply no longer my preference.  I find that room-temperature water with a bit of lemon does the trick if I'm parched, much more so than ice-water.</p> 

<p>While walking down the street today, I thought "since it's the standard at practically every restaurant in the US to bring you a glass of ice water when you patronize their establishment, what if the next time the waiter/waitress asked 'Something to drink?', everyone in the US responded with 'water, no ice please.'  Wouldn't restaurants, reacting to less demand, use ice-makers less frequently and thereby save vast amounts of energy?"</p>

<p>I don't have any reliable statistics at hand, but let's assume a rate of 3 restaurant visits per month per person in the US (population ~307M people.)  If one glass of ice-water is served during those visits, that's a lot of ice cubes.</p>
