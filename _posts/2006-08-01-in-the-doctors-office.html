I like Vienna for so many things but you have to love the customer service ethic that pervades all Viennese service professions, including in the doctor's office (chuckle!)  

Here's a real exchange - translated into English from German - between a patient (P) and a front desk attendant (A) that I witnessed today.

P: Excuse me but I've been waiting for over two hours. How much longer is it going to be? 

A: (somewhat agitated) I'm sorry, we're really full today.

P: It's really too much. Other people have come after me and they're alredy finished.

A: (really agitated) NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THEY CAME AND THEY WENT AND THEY CAME AGAIN. 

(P walks back to waiting room, A walks around corner to lab, comes back after finishing something, and yells at P who is no longer in sight...) 

A: ARE YOU GOING TO STAY OR ARE YOU GOING?!? 

(No response from P. A waits and waits and waits and finally returns to her business.)
