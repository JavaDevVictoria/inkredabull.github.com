In thinking about my <a href="http://www.thebullog.net/?p=177">fall from grace</a>, I came up with a list things that Mercer must have omitted:

 <ol>
   <li>Dog-droppings.  Everywhere.</li>
   <li>Smoke.  Everywhere.</li>
   <li>Viennese customer service.</li>
   <li>All the career opportunities.</li>
</ol>
