<p>It's been a while since my last post.  A lot has been going on in the last month.  For one, I've been doing a fitness class in the morning by the name of <a href="http://www.timeoutservices.com/bootcamp/community_boot_camp.aspx">"Bootcamp."</a></p>

<p>Our instructor is much more fun than a Drill Sergent but that doesn't mean he doesn't work us hard.  Just this morning we went for a mile run.  I did it in 6:20.  I don't know if I ran that fast in high school.  Considering that I ran it in 8:14 four weeks ago, I'd say that my cardio conditioning is definitely improving.  These last few months have been so crazy that I haven't been as physically active as I normally am but with that kind of mile-time, I'd say I'm back in the saddle again.</p>
