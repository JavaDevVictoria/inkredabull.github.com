When I started my latest job search, I selected about 20 top-tier companies I was interested in pursuing.  Oh how much simpler my life would have been if I could have just subscribed to some sort of "Software Developer" job feed at each company!  

Here's a suggestion to all you HR units out there - make all of your job descriptions into RSS-feeds!  I tried creating my my own Google Co-Op search engine but that wound up bombing because - I suspect - of the way that the jobs exist in the Deep Web.  

If one of the big online job boards came up with an *easy* way to track the positions I'm in at the companies I'm interested in, that'd be great but until then, I say markup the job descriptions as feeds!!!

UPDATE:  I found <a href="http://www.indeed.com">Indeed.</a>  Awesome.  You can search by job title, company, and/or geography, just to name a few of the (most important IMHO) criteria.  Salary search is in there too.
