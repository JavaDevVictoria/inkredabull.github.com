<p>In February 2010, I hit the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">GDC</a> when I <a href="http://www.thebullog.net/?p=161">came to SF</a> with the hopes of finding a job.  I thought, "surely, with my web skills... I'll be in-demand" but oh how sobering of an experience <a href="http://www.thebullog.net/?p=165">it was.</a></p>

<p>A few months later in July 2010, <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zynga">Zynga</a> was formed.</p>  Fast forward three years and I just caught the other day that Zynga's been reportedly valued at <a href="http://vator.tv/news/show/2010-04-07-report-zynga-valuation-at-5-billion">$5B.</a> A $5B business in three years?!?  Amazing.
