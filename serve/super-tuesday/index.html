<p>Hope you have already voted or are going to (if you can) later today.</p>

<p>This is my first election back in the States and I'm so excited about it.  When I was overseas, I got the absentee mail-in ballot for presidential elections but that was it.  Voting from abroad just didn't afford the opportunity for exposure to the debate that happens in the press and media.  Being physically present in the country again gives me the feeling of truly being a part of the democratic process again.</p>

<p>Here's something from my Voter Information Pamphlet &amp; Sample Ballot I thought very San Franciscan.  It's a question pertaining to wheelchair access.</p>

<p><em>Are the entryway and the voting area accessible?</em></p>

<p><em>12.5% slope on sidewalk</em></p>

<p>12.5%!!!   Only in San Francisco.  </p>
