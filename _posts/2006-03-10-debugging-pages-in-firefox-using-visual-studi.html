Given our internal configuration, I was having authentication problems while testing some code in Firefox and Netscape.&nbsp; It came to me that I would have to step through the authentication of our webapp using Visual Studio but I thought "How do I do this in Firefox with Visual Studio?"&nbsp;

It is possible, my thanks to <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/peter.van.ooijen/archive/2004/10/25/29621.aspx">Peter</a> for a thorough explanation of how it's done.
