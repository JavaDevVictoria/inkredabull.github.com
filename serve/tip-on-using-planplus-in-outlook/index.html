I installed PlanPlus (v4.0) several months ago and have been fighting with it ever since.  The problem has been when I tried to sync tasks.  I kept getting...

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>OK Outlook Tasks
HR[8000FFFF] Catastrophic failure
OK FranklinCovey PlanPlus for Outlook TaskList Conduit
Conduit 'FC Task List' Error: Unknown error. (65535)</pre></div>
</div>


I went back and forth with Franklin Covey and their support was good but in the end, it looks like there were some characters in the fields of a task or some tasks (don't ask me which) which were problematic.  

The workaround?  

<strong>WARNING/DISCLAIMER:  I am about to suggest deleting all of your tasks (with a way to get them back of course.)  I provide the advice below as-is with no warranty.</strong>


So here's what you do...

<ol>
<li>Export all of your tasks from Outlook into an Excel file</li>
<li>Now (right now!) make a copy of that Excel file and put it somewhere safe</li>
<li>Delete <strong>all</strong> of your tasks from the tasks folder in Outlook</li>
<li>In the export, check the tasks one-by-one (pay special attention to the "Notes" field1) to see if you see anything suspicious which you delete and then... </li>
<li>Import the tasks from the Excel file back into Outlook</li>
</ol>

If anything goes wrong, you can always import the backup of the Excel file (step 2!) back into Outlook.
