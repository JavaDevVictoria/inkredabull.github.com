I've got a relative in Vancouver and yesterday I realized that I hadn't sent his Christmas gift yet.  Whoops!  I went to Amazon.com to have something delivered by the weekend.  

I understand that maybe all of Amazon's inventory is <strong>not</strong> based in Seattle but I was hoping that in this case (what with Vancouver being across the border from Seattle) they would ship from there and the gift would arrive on time.

Long story short, I couldn't order the desired gift because Amazon can't ship this particular video game to Canada.  Ugh.  So, what did I do?  Naturally, I went to Amazon.ca and made the purchase there, but for some reason, the Canadian Amazon can't do delivery by this weekend.  

This morning, I got confirmation via email that the gift has indeed been shipped.  When I went to track it, I saw that it originated in Mississauga, Ontario!  Maybe I should have found a courier to pick up the order from Amazon.com in Seattle and take it across the border...
