I was having a rough time trying to figure out how to use JavaScript on a particular control.&nbsp; I wanted to use getElementById on a server control but of course, ASP .NET appends a bunch of stuff to the ID of anything you declare, so what was I to do?&nbsp; I had hopes that I could go through all the elements of the DOM and one-by-one, check their ID values against the string value I was looking for.&nbsp; Finally, I gave up when I found this tip:

document.getElementById('  ').value;
