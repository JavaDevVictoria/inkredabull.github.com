Today we learned how to conjugate verbs in the past perfect tense.&nbsp; OK, there are three groups of verbs (-ar, -ir, and -er) and with six different conjugations, that's 18 new possibilities.&nbsp; To practice, we played a game where one person starts by saying something they did yesterday.&nbsp; The next person repeats that sentence and then adds another sentence and so it goes around the room.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and throw in a couple of reflexive verbs that I didn't know how to deal with.&nbsp; I'm in a bit over my head but I'm loving it; it's a great challenge.
