<p>When I moved back to the US last year, I thought the bay area would be a place where the latest in information technology would permeate every facet of life.</p>

<p>Isn't it amazing that in a country regarded as having some of the best health care in the world, and in the bay area no less, I have to fill out forms with the same information about allergies, emergency contact, address, etc every time I go to the doctors.</p>
