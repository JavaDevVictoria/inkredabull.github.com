<p>After a couple of weeks of commuting from the city to the valley, now I understand why individualized entertainment devices and technologies are so big.  Whether the iPod or the PSP or a laptop or a Blackberry, I finally get it.</p>

<p>Sure, I used my iPod before (which I have inconveniently left in Vienna) but now, with two hours a day of forced downtime, I've never needed it more.  I could be conversing with my fellow commuters but honestly, do you ever see that happening?  Everyone's engrossed in their own private entertainment universe.</p>

<p>After a day at the office my mind's pretty tapped and all I want is to tune out too, for which watching a movie on a PSP or listening to my iPod or finding something to do in the evening online are ideally suited.</p>
