<p>One of the reasons I've posted so infrequently recently is because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>work's been crazy busy and</li>
  <li>I discovered <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a> and also <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jrockway/Test-WWW-Selenium-Catalyst-0.02/lib/Test/WWW/Selenium/Catalyst.pm">a way to test a Catalyst app with Selenium</a>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Both took a while to get running right on my RHEL 4 box but when they did, wow!  Impressive white box testing.</p>
