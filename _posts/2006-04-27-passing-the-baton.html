Today I couldn't help but think of when I was in school and ran on relay teams.&nbsp; Over the four years, I was in the 4x100 and the 4x200 and did everything from come out of the blocks to run the anchor leg.&nbsp;

The reason I thought of it was because of the baton passing.&nbsp; I didn't realize just how metaphorical it is until today.&nbsp; Not only is it important to be good at passing the baton but also at passing the baton.&nbsp; That's just as applicable to an actual race as it is for say, team presentations or handling customer service requests for that matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;
