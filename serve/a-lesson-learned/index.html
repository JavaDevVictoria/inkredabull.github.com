Real Estate agencies in Vienna charge a 3-month commission for finding an apartment.&nbsp; I haven't looked for an apt. in a major city in the US but I wouldn't be surprised if it were the same there.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I'm using an agency and they've found me an apartment and therefore I'll be paying the comission.&nbsp; After a week of waiting to hear about when I could move in, I finally called on Monday to find out that the earliest I could sign the rental agreement would be on Thursday.&nbsp; Keep in mind that I wanted to move in on the weekend, given my work schedule. &nbsp;Here's the conversation, translated from German:

"Could we meet any earlier so that I could be sure to get the keys before the weekend?"

"No."

"Absolutely no possibility?" &nbsp;

"No." &nbsp;

Allllllright.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Could I get a copy of the rental agreement, given that I'm not a native German speaker and that I'd like to look over it at my leisure before I sign it?" &nbsp;

"That's not possible." &nbsp;

"Absolutely no possibility?" &nbsp;

"No." &nbsp;

Allllllright.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I guess the commission isn't for service.&nbsp; What is it for then?
