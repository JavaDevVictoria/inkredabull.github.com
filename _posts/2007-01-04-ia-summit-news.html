The good news is that I just got word that the poster I submitted for the IA Summit has been accepted.  

Entitled "Nucleus: The Authoritative Resource for Scientific and Technical Nuclear Information," the Case Study was to highlight work I've done with the IAEA on their new nuclear information initiative <a href="http://nucleus.iaea.org">http://nucleus.iaea.org</a>.

The bad news is that my travel plans have changed for the coming months so I don't expect that I'll be able to present in Las Vegas.
