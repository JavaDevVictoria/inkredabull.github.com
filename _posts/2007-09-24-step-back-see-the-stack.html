<p>When was the last time I heard "WSDL" used in the same sentence as "AJAX"?  While it seems that the emphasis of the conference is less on jaw-dropping functionality and more on the back-end plumbing to make scalable *wow* experiences possible, it is nice to revisit the complete stack, front- to back-end, from the data repository (whether RSS or a database or a Mashup API or WSDL) all the way to the UI.</p>

<p>Even though I don't think I'm going to get as much front-end BOF camaraderie in these two and a half days, it is good to step back and look at the stack of technologies that must work together to bring information to users.</p>
