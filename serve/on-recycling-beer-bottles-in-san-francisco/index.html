<p>My advice:  don't do it!  (because you can't!)</p>

<p>I took beer bottles to three local supermarkets and one liquor store and nowhere could I get the deposit back nor even recycle the bottles!</p>

<p>When I moved to Vienna a few years ago, I had the growing pains any expat experiences in getting to know a new environment;  things like nothing being open on Sundays, dealing with local bureaucracy, little old ladies elbowing their way to the front of the line, you know, things like that.</p>

<p>When I moved to San Francisco, I thought "Hey, I'm back in my home country.  I know how things work here!"</p>

<p><em>"Surprise, surprise, Mr. Michigander - we Californians don't have your fancy 10 cent deposit on bottles!"</em></p>  

<p>For a state that prides itself on recycling, I found it strange that it's so hard to get the deposit back on bottles.</p>
