Wow. The <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/conference/keynotes.htm#shigeru">creator of Donkey Kong and Super Mario Brothers not to mention major creative force behind the Wii</a> is an amazing personality.  I knew I should have studied Industrial Design.  If only I would have heard of the field before I graduated from undergraduate.

In other news, I'm either way ahead of the curve in the gaming industry or I'm crazy.  I'd like to believe that the former was verified today by <a href="http://www.raphkoster.com">Raph Koster</a> in his session on the <a href="https://www.cmpevents.com/GD07/a.asp?option=C&amp;V=11&amp;SessID=4477">intersection of gaming and the web</a> where I was one of few "web geeks" in a room of 100 attendees.

I had expectations coming into the conference that web technologies would have would have an important role in the gaming community but I've been enlightened in the last four days.  Raph summarized the business processes of creating a console game (which was of great help for me) and compared/contrasted that with web development.  What an eye opener.
