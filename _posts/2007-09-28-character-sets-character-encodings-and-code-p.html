<p>So I attended an "Intro to Unicode" class yesterday which would have been so helpful before my last job at the IAEA.  After having tackled the i18n problem there, Mojibake seems old-hat.</p>

<p>In other news, I finally installed Aptana.  What a great piece of software.  It's refreshing to be using an IDE again although months of command-line interaction have tuned my rusty chops.</p>
