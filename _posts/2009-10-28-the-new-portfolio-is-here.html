<p>Happy to report that the portfolio you now see to the right is completely dynamically generated and driven by XML and XSLT.  I still need to work on details for some of the projects (if you click around and notice that some of them are empty or you get an error, that's because I haven't gotten around to fleshing them out yet. Check back soon!)</p>

<p>TODO</p>
<ul>
<li>flesh out projects</li>
<li>fix styling</li>
<li>create stylesheet for generating resume page as HTML</li> 
<li>portfolio plugin for WordPress plugin?</li> 
<li>add code samples</li>
</ul>

<p><em>UPDATE:  Sigh, search doesn't work for my resume (which is in XML) because it's not indexed.</em></p>
