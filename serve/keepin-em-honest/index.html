As I hand-code some validation in JavaScript for checking dates (an end date is equal to or later than a start date,) I can't help but think of something my high school football/basketball coach used to say.  I'll admit, I forget the entire context but I think it was something he said while we were practicing.  

Coach knew that to have a good offense, the offensive team had to scrimmage against a good defense.  For those of us on the defensive team, our job was to "keep 'em (our offense) honest" by practicing as we would play; by defending as though we were in a live situation with the game on the line.  

While it seems that gridiron defense and validating dates don't have much to do with each other, I can't help but think how hand-coding is keeping me honest as a web developer, especially in light of <a href="http://www.thebullog.net/?p=113">my recent experience</a> with the .NET CompareValidator.
