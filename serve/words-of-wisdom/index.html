<article class="post">
My swimming coach summarized something this morning that resonated so well.&nbsp; He was describing why he works out.&nbsp; Paraphrased from German, he said that it wasn't because he wants to change his body, but rather, to be able to enjoy eating things and not worry about the consequences.&nbsp; It's more of a proactive than a reactive approach to&nbsp;weight management.&nbsp;I like that.
