In my quest to find an online replacement for MS Outlook, I've found <a href="http://www.airset.com">AirSet</a> which can be integrated with BaseCamp for project management as well as sync'ed with Outlook and my Palm via a downloadable component.  I guess you have to throw <a href="http://remotecalendars.sourceforge.net">RemoteCalenders</a> in there too.
