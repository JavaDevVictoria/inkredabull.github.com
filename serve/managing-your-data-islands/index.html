A couple of days ago, my brother asked me what "Best Practices" IT professionals are using to manage all the information on all our different devices as he's recently acquired a second PC, has one or more USB memory sticks, lots of CDs &amp; DVDs, a PDA, etc.&nbsp; My advice:&nbsp; the fewer devices you have, the less you have to manage.

I was thinking about what I said last night and realized that if you're going to have a USB memory stick, make sure it's small (in the neighborhood of 128 or 256 MB "small.")&nbsp; That way, you can only carry the most important files on it because space is limited.
