I wandered around today and visited a few sessions as well as the expo hall.  I really didn't see the utility of motion-based sensor software and other kinds of supplies for the gaming industry to me as a web developer until the evening.  I went to a Dr. Dobb's session on Second Life which pretty much was a bit of marketing for <a href="http://www.btobonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070308/FREE/70308008/1078">this event.</a>  It was at the session that I really was exposed to what Second Life is like (dancing avatars!) and that's when I got excited about the possibilities of the metaverse.

I don't know if motion-based sensor software/hardware can be "exported" to Second Life (though I understand export works for Maya and AutoCAD) but if so, the customization possibilities are crazy.  Nintendo Wii?  Playstation Home?  XBOX Live?  Mainstream MMOGs?  This is crazy stuff.
