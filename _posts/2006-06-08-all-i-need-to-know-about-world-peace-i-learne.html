Yesterday, it dawned on me that all we need to know about improving political relations and easing tensions we can learn from Robert Fulghum. I find these particular points particulary relevant:
<ul>
	<li>Play fair.</li>
	<li>Don't hit people.</li>
	<li>Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.</li>
</ul>
