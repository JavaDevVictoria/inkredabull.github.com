Another great thing about where I work is that people not only learn so many languages, they use them.&nbsp; For instance, there's one person in my hall whom I just overheard.&nbsp; I've known her for the five months I've been in this job and I knew that she could speak several different languages but I just realized&nbsp;that&nbsp;in the course of the last hour and a half, I've heard her having conversations with different people in German, French, Spanish, and English.
