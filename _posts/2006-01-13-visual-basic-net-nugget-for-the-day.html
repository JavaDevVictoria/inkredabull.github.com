So, there I was trying to figure out how to instantiate a class when all I have is the name of the class as held in a string variable.&nbsp; Thanks to <a href="http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/58/293439.aspx">this</a>, it's easy:

Dim objInstance As Object

Dim reportType As Type = Type.GetType(sReport)

objInstance = Activator.CreateInstance(Nothing, objType)
