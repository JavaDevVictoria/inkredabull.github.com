<p>After a session yesterday on using Eclipse for AJAX applications, I thought "Wow, it'd be nice to have an IDE again."  I've been doing a lot of vi from the commandline (to be fair, I've also been using alot of gvim so it's halfway GUI-oriented.)  Anyway, this morning, I installed Eclipse and tried to add plugins for vi and Perl.  It now seems that I need to have a Perl interpreter too.  Duh.  I wonder if having an IDE would make me any more efficient.  Certainly it makes the visualization of a "project" easier.</p>

<p>On that note, I visited a session on doing AJAX apps in Zend with PHP.  An MVC paradigm implemented in the IDE: nice! </p>
