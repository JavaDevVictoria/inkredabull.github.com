<p>One day, many years ago when I was finishing my undergrad at a small college in West Michigan, I sat in as a session drummer for a local band. &nbsp;Indie folk rock wasn't my thing but I knew a couple of people in the band so I did them a favor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not long thereafter,&nbsp;<a href="http://asthmatickitty.com/shannon-stephens" title="Shannon Stepehens" target="_blank">Shannon Stephens</a>&nbsp;- lead singer of the band - handed me a cassette recording of that&nbsp;session. I tossed it in a box and forgot about it. &nbsp;Little did I know, that band - Marzuki&nbsp;- would go on to do big things in the folk indie rock scene.</p>
<p><span>About two years ago, I saw mention of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://music.sufjan.com/" title="Sufjan Stevens" target="_blank">Sufjan Stevens</a><span>&nbsp;in some mainstream media, but couldn't believe my eyes. &nbsp;It didn't take long (a few searches) to find out that it was one-and-the-same. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I became curious about the location of that cassette from so many years before, but couldn't find it in any of my boxes in San Francisco. When I was last in Michigan, about a year ago, I sifted through my dusty belongings and finally found it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>For the last year, it collected dust again. This evening, though, I finally sat down and with the help of&nbsp;instructions from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/222394/alpha-geek-how-to-digitize-cassette-tapes" title="Lifehacker" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a>&nbsp;(and a bit of help from&nbsp;my wife&nbsp;<a href="http://wavelounge.blogspot.com/" title="Visda" target="_blank">Visda</a>&nbsp;to get Audacity set up,)&nbsp;I digiitzed all three tracks at a little over ten minutes of music. &nbsp;Here's a shot of the cassette and my wife's tape-player (which had also been gathering dust as you can imagine):</p>

<p>I was ecstatic to digitze all three songs (hooking up the tape-player to my Mac Mini and capturing the output went smoothly) and wanted to share them, but since I'm not&nbsp;exactly sure if I have the copyright to post the entire songs, I decided to sample them and post to Soundcloud to test the waters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please excuse the cleanliness of the edits: it was my first time using Audacity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first entitled&nbsp;<a href="http://soundcloud.com/inkredabull/why-dont-you-want-me">Why Don't You Want Me</a>, you'll hear me on bongos. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In the second track -&nbsp;<a href="http://soundcloud.com/inkredabull/burn-through-me">Burn Through Me</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;I switch to drumset. &nbsp;You'll hear Sufjan on recorder.</p>

<p><span>In the final track, don't strain to hear too much of me: best I can tell from the recording (and remember) - I sat this one out, but do listen for Sufjan's recorder again. Here's&nbsp;</span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/inkredabull/longing">Longing</a>:&nbsp;</p>
