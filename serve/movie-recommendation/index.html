<article class="post">
<p>Last night, I had the pleasure and privilege of attending an advance screening in Berkeley of a movie you should go and see: <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/persepolis/">Persepolis</a>.</p>

<p>Since I read both books last year, I've been recommending them to all non-Iranians I know.  Although I'm linking to Amazon to recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Persepolis-Boxed-Set-Marjane-Satrapi/dp/0375423966/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1196439382&amp;sr=8-2">the boxed set</a>, I highly suggest you get them wherever you can find them.</p>

<p>I like the story because it's a great mix of humor and pathos but also because it compacts the last (fascinating) three decades of history of Iran in under two hours in the case of the movie or less than a pair of days in the case of the print versions.</p>  

<p>I think the author does a great job of taking the story from print to the big screen.  That having been said, I do prefer the print version because I think the movie races through historical events the print version affords time to digest.</p>
