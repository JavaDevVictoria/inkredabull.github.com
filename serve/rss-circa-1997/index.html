Imagine a service that "will save your favorite search engine queries and web sites, check them periodically, and send you email whenever there are new or updated web pages."&nbsp;&nbsp;

Today's quiz question:&nbsp;&nbsp;When did this service first appear?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>2005</li>
	<li>2000</li>
	<li>1997</li>
</ul>
Thanks to the Wayback Machine, the answer is 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't quite that long ago that I used the service but I'm surprised at how similar it was to RSS (minus pictures and a couple of other features.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how they did it (some Perl with 'diff'?) but it was great to get information pushed to me whenever a website I was interested in was updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I just track RSS feeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't it great how easy life has become?&nbsp;&nbsp;

FYI, the service was The Informant, now TracerLock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of paying for TracerLock, I'm currently working on my own tool...)&nbsp;
