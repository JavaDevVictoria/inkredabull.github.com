<p>Lots to catch up on.  Have been away for ten days in Austria and just got back today.  Happy New Year!</p>

<p>One of many topics to blog about from the trip happened today as we were landing.  An announcement came from the cockpit that anybody with a connecting flight to a destination in the US other than San Francisco would need to check any duty-free liquids they'd bought.</p>

<p>"What a pain," I thought, "people make it all the way from Europe with duty-free goods in their hand luggage and then they have to risk the bottle(s) breaking in their checked luggage."</p>

<p>As I mulled the misfortune of those affected,  I couldn't help but think of the poor soul (a US citizen) I saw the last time I was in Frankfurt who had purchased a bottle of Limoncello in Italy, flew to Germany, and then was stopped by the German security officers who refused to let him board a flight to the US with the bottle.</p> 

<p>He had purchased the bottle in an Italian duty-free shop and it had been sealed in a plastic bag according to European standards.  When he arrived in Germany, he was told that the Italian security measures weren't enough for a US flight and that he wouldn't be allowed to carry the bottle on with him.  </p>

<p>After about ten minutes of bickering with the German security personnel, he took the bottle and do you know what he did?  He downed it!  Good thing I wasn't sitting next to him...</p>
