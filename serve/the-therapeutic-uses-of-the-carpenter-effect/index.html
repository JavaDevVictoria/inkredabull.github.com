<article class="post">
During recovery from my pyeloplasty, I've been making use of a technique recommended by <a href="http://www.sc-donau.at/schwimmen/trainerportraits/tlombardini.html">my swim coach.</a>  He told me about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_effect">Carpenter effect (a.k.a. the Ideomotor effect.)</a> If you check out the Wikipedia entry on the topic, you'll find an explanation of the phenomena but not exactly as my coach described it.

He explained that - while not yet scientifically proven - people who mentally train while physically incapacitated lose less muscle mass during their convalescence. I've been giving this a try. In my mind, I go through three sets of twelve reps for all the major muscle groups and imagine that I'm training to failure at the end of the third set. I haven't had any muscle soreness the day after but if nothing else, I'm super relaxed after my "session" is done.
