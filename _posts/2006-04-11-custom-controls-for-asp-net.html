Today I was doing an XML transformation (with XSLT) in a Page_Load when I realized that the timing was off. I realized that the output was being sent too early to the response stream and I thought "I've seen this before... How do I fix this?"

Thank goodness for Custom Controls, or, I should rather say, being able to override the Render method.

In looking around about how exactly to do that, I discoverd <a href="http://samples.gotdotnet.com/quickstart/aspplus/doc/webctrlauthoring.aspx">this tutorial</a> on Developing a Simple Custom Control.
