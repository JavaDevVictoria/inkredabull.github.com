<p>Back in 2006, my wife came up with an idea for her Master&#8217;s thesis around the concept of a <a href='http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1125797'>gamified pedometer</a> and &#8220;tackled the challenge of motivating people [&#8230;] to exercise more [using] a device which encourages physical activity of its users in an entertaining way and reinforces positive exercise habits.&#8221; Here I am in 2014; considering getting a Fitbit (a little pre-Christmas gift to myself?)</p>

<p>Which one should I get?</p>

<h3 id='making_a_choice'>Making a Choice</h3>

<p>As I scan the <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/compare'>Fitbit website</a>, it&#8217;s obivous I need to figure out what my main Use Case is going to be.</p>

<p>Checking out the <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/chargehr'>Charge HR</a>, I&#8217;m reminded of a time years ago when I used something very similar: my Timex Ironman Triathlon heart-rate monitor! Wondering where it was, I dug around in my belongings and sure enough, I found it (albeit dusty):</p>

<p><img alt='Timex Ironman Triathlon' src='./images/photos/timex_ironman.jpg' /></p>

<p>Wow; not sure how long ago I got that. I think I was living in Vienna, so it&#8217;s at least eight years old. I could have sworn I got it shipped to me via Amazon but I don&#8217;t see it listed anywhere in my last 12 years (12!) of order history with them, so I must have picked it up there at some brick-and-mortar store.</p>

<p>Anyways, the Charge HR isn&#8217;t even available yet and judging by how much dust the Timex has collected in the last five years, maybe that&#8217;s not the best model for me right now.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/surge'>Surge</a> looks like it does everything under the sun. &#8220;Music Control&#8221; - very intriguing. One problem; also not yet available.</p>

<p>While comparing the wearable models, I came across the <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/aria'>Aria</a> and wonder how it compares with the <a href='http://www.withings.com/us/smart-body-analyzer.html'>Withings scale</a>. I bet the value-add is how well it integrates within the Fitbit ecosystem.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little hesitant to even consider any of the timepiece models as a replacement for the <a href='http://www.skagen.com/us/en/products/grenen-mens-steel-mesh-and-titanium-case-watch-pdp233lttmp.html'>beautiful watch</a> my wife got me for my birthday years ago, so that rules out the Charge, Charge HR, and the Surge and really only leaves the Zip, One, and Flex.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been waking up fairly early recently so I definitely think it would be helpful to have a model that tracks my sleep habits, eliminating the Zip.</p>

<h3 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Between the One and the Flex, I think I&#8217;m going to go with the <a href='http://www.fitbit.com/one'>One</a>. I really don&#8217;t want to wear a second item on my wrist in addition to my watch so the One it is.</p>
