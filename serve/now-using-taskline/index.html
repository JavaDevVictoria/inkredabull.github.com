<p>I finally bit the bullet and bought a license for <a href="http://www.taskline.info/default.asp">Taskline</a>.&nbsp; I like it a lot.&nbsp; I learned about Taskline after reading <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/btinkler/archive/2005/08/26/51152.aspx">this guy's</a> blog and let me just say, I thought I knew a thing or two about time management but I can't hold a candle to his system.&nbsp; I wonder how much time he spends maintaining the entire construction&nbsp;but nonetheless, he did draw my attention to Taskline.</p>

<p>I'm one to have a lot of ideas and I'm prone to write them done.&nbsp; Things like "oh yeah, I definitely have to do that!!!" which then make their way into my PDA and onto my to do list (e.g. tasklist in Outlook.)</p>&nbsp;
<p>I'm always frustrated that I never get to everything and that's where Taskline is coming in useful.&nbsp; Now I can graphically see just how much time I really have.&nbsp; I love the visualization aspect of the tool:&nbsp; that I can guesstimate how long my tasks are going to take and then see if they realistically slot in to the time I have available.&nbsp; This has humbled me a great deal.&nbsp;</p>
