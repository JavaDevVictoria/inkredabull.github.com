Yesterday marks day 365 of being in the capital of Austria.&nbsp; Amazing that it was a year aqo that I arrived.&nbsp; I remember the anxiety of looking for a job while not having a work permit, confident that I'd find a company who'd sponsor me.&nbsp;

I took a look at my calendar from July 2003 and what an ambitious schedule I had arranged for myself - from the States no less!&nbsp; And now, I'm sitting well personally and professionally and all of the risks were worth it.
