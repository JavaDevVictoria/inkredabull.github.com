Here at the IAEA, recognition has recently been granted to staff members who've been with the organization for 20+ years.  

Here are the totals for the number of people recognized and the years they've served.  When's the last time you heard about somebody being with an organization for 35 years?

<div align="center">
<table border="1px">
<tr>
<td><em>Years of Service</em></td>
<td><em># of People</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">35</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">30</td>
<td align="center">24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">25</td>
<td align="center">44</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">20</td>
<td align="center">34</td>

</table>

<b>UPDATE:</b>  As luck would have it, I just found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barker">someone else</a> who's been in his business for 35 years.
