<p>I ran a 1:21:59 in the Bay to Breakers race last week.  While I'm certainly not going to give the Kenyans a run for their money (and, at just over $1,000 a minute when you take winnings divided by time, that's a pretty decent hourly wage,) I was happy with the time and to finish the race without even really training beforehand.</p>

<p>I recently got an email about the photos which were professionally taken along the race route.  I was really looking forward to them but the company that took the photos isn't making them available for download.  The only way you can get a digital copy is if you order a photo CD which costs $59.95 for the entire batch of photos taken of you or $34.95 for a single image.</p>

<p>All of their images have watermarks.  I'd like to have one or two of the shots but certainly not all of them (and certainly not at $59.95) so I tried to right-click an image to save it and I noticed that I couldn't.  Sure enough, when I inspected the source, I found some Javascript:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>// Disable right-click
if (event.keycode == 96) { return false; }</pre></div>
</div>
