<p>Can you believe it?  I'm playing with electronic PIMs again.  I keep thinking I'll find the perfect Outlook-like app for the web that offers the same speedy functionality whether on a mobile device or in a browser on my desktop.</p>

<p>This morning I was playing around with AirSet on my mobile phone.  What it lacks in speed it makes up for in ubiquity.  Now, if only I could email tasks to a certain list...</p>

<p>One of the reasons cool things about Gmail is <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/top-10-little-known-gmail-features-part.html#links">number ten on the list of little-known Gmail features</a>; the ability to modify "from" in the email header.

Now, if they only had great mobile service like AirSet...</p>
