<p>I've been meaning for a long time to synchronize my resume, portfolio, and LinkedIn profile.  The portfolio to the right that you're currently seeing is static and has been a beast to maintain, as have the corresponding pages (which are all managed by WordPress as a CMS.)</p>  

<p>I've finally taken the time and decomposed my resume into XML.  Soon I'll be able to use one source file and a few stylesheets to render a web version of the resume, updates for my LinkedIn profile (which I'll probably have to cut-and-paste,) the portfolio on this site, and a simple text version of my resume for online job apps (though, when will I need that last one?)</p>
