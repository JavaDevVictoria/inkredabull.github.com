<p>When creating an event in Thunderbird (using the Lightning plugin,) I couldn't get access to LDAP for doing a lookup in order to invite attendees.</p>

<p>Found a tip on how to do it (if you don't have an LDAP server configured already, you'll need to find info on how to do that elsewhere):</p>

<em>Thunderbird grabs the information separately.  you will need to add  
your ldap server to thunderbird by going to "Preferences-&gt;Composition-
 &gt;Addressing-&gt;Add directories..."</em>

<p>See the full thread <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Free---Busy-times-troubleshooting-td18096353.html">here</a>.</p>
