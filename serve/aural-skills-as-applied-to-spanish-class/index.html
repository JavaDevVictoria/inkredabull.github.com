In Spanish class today, like on many other days, we had to read a dialogue aloud.&nbsp; I read the masculine voice, a woman read the feminine voice.&nbsp; As we were reading, I was struck not so much by the similiarity of reading completely new texts in Spanish to that of sight reading solfege but rather that it's taken me so long to see the pattern.&nbsp;

&nbsp;I mean, when I was learning German, it never dawned on me.&nbsp; Today, while reading "unos discos compactos y las empanadas que mi mama va a preparar" - which was tough to get out the first time with the right melody and intonation - only then did it strike me "wow, this is so much like sight reading!&nbsp; Why haven't I ever seen that before?"
