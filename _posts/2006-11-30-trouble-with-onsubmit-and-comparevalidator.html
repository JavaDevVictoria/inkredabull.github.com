To do some validation on two dates (an end date and a start date where the end date shouldn't be earlier than the start date,) I tried making use of the CompareValidator.  After much frustration, I finally got rid of it and coded the JavaScript for the validation myself.

I was making use of a CompareValidator control in a webform along with a hyperlink-as-submit-button ala <a href="http://www.javascript-coder.com/javascript-form/javascript-form-submit.phtml">this tutorial.</a>  When I tested the hyperlink, I got this:

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>'event' is null or not an object</pre></div>
</div>


When I tried this...

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>alert(document.theForm.onsubmit);</pre></div>
</div>


I got this in the popup...

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>function anonymous() {
          if(!ValdiatorOnSubmit()) 
               return false;
  }</pre></div>
</div>


...which seemed to indicate that the onsubmit event is hooked into the .NET web validation javascript via a pointer somewhere.  What to do?  How about including an invisbile submit button to force the form submission (thank you <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/htmldom/dom_obj_submit.asp">W3Schools</a>!) ala:

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>document.getElementById('InivisibleSubmitButton').click();</pre></div>
</div>
  

The problem I ran into was that I couldn't test whether the technique returned true (validation OK) or false (try again) which was necessary before submitting the values to commit to the database.  

In the end, I wound up including my own JavaScript to validate the dates.  No post backs, just simple validation client-side.
