I know this advice will apply to a grand total of 3 of you out there in reader land but here are my tips and tricks for landing a job from approx. 6000 miles away.
<ol>
<li>
<b>Get yourself a SkypeIn number.  Or two.</b>  <br />408 and 415 probably don't mean much to you if you don't live in the Bay Area but they're two of the most important local area codes.  Moral:  get a local phone number and you appear local (and that's a good thing.)</li>

<li>
<b>Start saving for the move</b> <br /> 'cause you're going to need it.  As of today, I have yet to have spoken with a company that was willing to internationally relocate me, which leads me to the next tip...</li>

<li>
<b>Start applying a year before you go</b>  <br />Ok, maybe a year's a bit much, but three months won't hurt.</li>

<li>
<b>Show up to the interview with jetlag</b>  <br />I arrived in SF at 6:40 PM one night and had a six hour interview with 6 different people the next day.  I'm not talking fluffy stuff either; they threw me some hardcore CS problems and I had to dust the mental cobwebs off to recall topics I haven't touched in several years.  Better believe I was hurting at a couple of points during the day.  Four coffees helped.  The following morning, they offered.  Worked for me, it'll work for you ;-)</li>  

<li>
<b>Practice, practice, practice</b>  <br />In the last year, I've had no less than 20 phone screens (most of which while I was in Austria,) 10 phone interviews, and four four-hour or longer in-person interviews.  That made a difference in being polished for when the right time and the right opportunity came along.</li>  

<li>
<b>Find temporary living</b> <br />It helps if you have awesome relatives who are willing to let you stay with him when you arrive and are looking for an apartment.  Alternatively, do a search for "short term furnished rentals."  I liked <a href="http://www.gaylordsuites.com/">Gaylord Suites</a>:  a bit close to the 'loin but that just makes it all the more interesting. </li>

<li>
<b>Go to Iran</b> <br /> That's right; the fastest way to San Francisco from Vienna is through... Iran!  Alright, I'm not being serious but in general, I think you should go if you get the chance.  It's a beautiful, amazing, and perplexing country; don't believe the hype.
</li>

</ol>
