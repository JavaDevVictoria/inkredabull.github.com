<p>While watching TV on Friday morning at the gym, I heard that 38 million Americans will be traveling this Memorial Day weekend. Most of them will be going by car, even with gas prices as high as they are. </p>

<p>With the exception of 2001 and 2002, I've been out of the country for the last ten years on Memorial Day.  Overseas, I was reminded when Memorial Day was approaching because relatives would mention it on the phone or I saw it online in a newspaper.  

</p><p>I lost touch, though, with the nature of the holiday weekend because, well, I hadn't seen or heard figures like those I heard on Friday morning.   It was like Deja Vu.  Nothing's really changed in ten years' time when it comes to American's dependence on oil, has it?</p>
