<p>More geek points for me:  I Ghosted my setup in Vienna before coming over figuring I would buy a system here and then overwrite it with my previous set-up.  I figured that I was all clever and stuff and would save myself inordinate amounts of time not having to re-configure my apps and everything. </p>

<p>Time I probably would have spent just grabbing the data: a couple of hours</p>

<p>Time I spent on Ghosting with its ensuing hardware/driver problems:  much more than that</p>
