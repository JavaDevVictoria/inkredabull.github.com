I looked and looked and looked but I couldn''t find the answer anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go ahead, I dare you to Google the question.&nbsp; It's a simple question, right?&nbsp; I mean, whenever you were studying for an exam while a student, you knew what sorts of questions to expect most of the time, right?&nbsp; I think Microsoft takes itself a little too seriously if it wants to guard information as inane as that.

But here's the answer I got back from them when I posed the question:&nbsp; How is [an MCAD] exam structured?&nbsp; I guess the following answers the question.&nbsp;&nbsp; You be the judge...

"Hello Tony,

Thank you for your e-mail regarding the exam formats.

We are glad to hear you would like to achieve the MCAD certification. Microsoft Certified Professional exams are administered in three general formats: Short Standard, Standard, and Adaptive Exams.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may receive any of these formats at any time for any exam.

Short Standard exams contain 20 to 30 questions and last approximately one hour.

Standard exams contain between 50 and 70 questions and last approximately 90 minutes.

Adaptive exams contain 15 to 30 questions and vary in time allowed.

Candidates are expected to understand the exam content, regardless of how it is presented. Therefore, Microsoft changes the exam format and questions from time to time. In addition, Microsoft does not identify the format of any given exam at the time of registration. Both practices help protect exam security and the value of Microsoft certification. To prepare for the exam, candidates should use the exam objectives listed in the exam preparation guide.

Also, MCP exams often contain new testing technologies. Please visit the below URL to learn about these technologies and be prepared to test with them.
