There I was, in need of a portable email delivery service but not wanting to pay for it on a monthly basis.&nbsp; I was waiting for an important email and I already have a cellphone so all I needed was a text message to be sent to me whenever the email came.&nbsp;

I looked for all things "email2sms" and found <a href="http://www.fastsms.co.uk/email2sms/">this</a>, which seemed like a good option until I realized that it would be 10 Pounds for&nbsp;the basic package!&nbsp; For that much, I started to think how I could code a quick solution myself (a "Hackberry" if you will...) but then I came across <a href="http://www.ipipi.com">ipipi</a>.&nbsp; Ah... I heart telecom.
