<p>My advice:  do it!</p>

<p>I just flew from Frankfurt to San Francisco in business class and I may never be able to fly any other way ever again.  When we were already eight hours into the 11 hour flight, I thought "Woah!  Only three more hours!  I better watch another movie!"</p>

<p>Why didn't I fly business class round trip?  Let me break it down for you.  Here's how the conversation went in order to get the upgrade.  Keep in mind that I swear that I read on the website of a prominent German airline that it was 60,000 miles to upgrade a roundtrip flight to Europe.</p>

<p>"Hello?  I'd like to upgrade my flight to Austria."</p>
<p>"Very good sir.  I see that you have 60,000 miles.  Which flight would you like to upgrade?"</p>
<p>"Uhhhhh... the whole one."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry sir, you only have 60,000 miles.  You can only upgrade one flight."</p>
<p>"Uhhhhh..."</p>
<p>"You could do the San Francisco to Munich flight, or the Munich to Vienna flight, or ..."
</p><p>(Me, to myself .... "Oh, what they call 'flight' I call 'leg'...")</p>

<p>Lesson learned.</p>

<p>I've been saving those miles for five years now and even been using a credit card to accrue miles.  In the end, I was disappointed that it really takes four times as many miles as I expected to get the upgrade for the round trip but I was happy to fly with enough leg room for a change.</p>
