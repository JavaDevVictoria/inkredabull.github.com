<p>Not much to report because it was a short day today.  A session on MVC for AJAX proved interesting though heady.</p>

<p>One of the topics covered is certainly not bleeding-edge but still fascinating nonetheless:  a comparison of traditional MVC apps vs MVC as implemented using a browser and then bringing it all back to AJAX as an implementation of traditional MVC-like paradigms *in* the browser.</p> 

<p>I think I need to find more developer-centric conferences in the future.  My attention was brought to <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/web2006/">one by O'Reilly</a> as well as <a href="http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/">another one held both in SF and Boston.</a>  Hopefully, you'll see me there.</p>
