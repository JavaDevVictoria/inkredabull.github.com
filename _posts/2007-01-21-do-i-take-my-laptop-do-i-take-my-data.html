Am getting ready for a trip to San Francisco/Las Vegas in March.  Should I just put all my data on an ultraslim external harddrive because I could just rent a laptop while there?  That would save a lot of space in (best scenario) my carry-on or (worst scenario) my suitcase.  

It's only worth taking the laptop if I need specific software.  Will have to look into just how flexible laptop rentals can be about that and exactly which software I'll need.
