<p>Using my iPhone, I just realized the utility of a search box or sitemaps for a site when viewed with a mobile device. Usually, if I'm looking for a keyword on a page, I'll just CTRL-F it to find it quickly.  In the abscence of such functionality on the Safari browser, search and/or sitemaps become necessary.</p>
