What a month it's been!&nbsp; The four weeks I just spent in a conversation class for Spanish have been even more intense than&nbsp;the crash course Hungarian I had back in 1997 for two weeks.&nbsp; The teacher's even invited me to enroll for the third level of Spanish&nbsp;in the Fall and completely skip&nbsp;the second semester; just like when I went from German 102 straight into German 301.&nbsp;

My goal now:&nbsp; 15 minutes of Spanish every day to keep it up until&nbsp;the next class.&nbsp;
