<p>I was trying to figure out how to embed some JavaScript in a System.Web.UI.WebControls.HyperLink control when I came across <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Languages/Dot_Net/ASP_DOT_NET/Q_21140530.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>.....but the only problem was that I was passing parameters to the JavaScript function in question and the single quotes were getting all messed up.</p>

<p>Finally, I just put a DIV tag with runat=server around a regular anchor tag (  ) and used logic in the code-behind to show/hide that.</p>
