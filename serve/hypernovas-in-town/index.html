<p>I hadn't heard of <a href="http://hypernovamusic.com/">them</a> before yesterday and I probably won't be going to see them.</p> 

<p>However, as I looked around for info on them, I found that no one refers to them as the "Ayatollah[s] of Rockandrollah!"  Seems like a perfectly good tag line given their origin.  </p>

<p>There you go, kids, giving you that one for free.</p><p>

</p><p>UPDATE:  I did go to see them.  They were OK as far as rock bands go but the thing is, they weren't just any old rock band, they were a rock band from Iran.  As I looked around, I took for granted that we (the collective "we" of the audience) were free to gather in an open space and listen to music, an environment the band is unlikely to have in Tehran.</p>
