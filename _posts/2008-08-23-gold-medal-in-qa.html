<p>Today, after a week battling Perl, Java, Selenium, crontabs, virtual roots and vm's, I finally have a fairly decent working solution for automated regression testing.</p>

<h3>Where did it start?</h3>

<p>I was handed a legacy web app in Perl which came with *NO* testing whatsoever and asked to add some new features.  How were we supposed to know if a new feature broke any old ones?  We'd hear it from users.</p>

<p>That wasn't a good situation so I set about to bolt on some regression testing.  It took longer than anticipated but it's good for the overall health of the app so I can rationalize the time spent.</p>

<p>I had previously used <a href="http://selenium-rc.openqa.org/">Selenium RC</a> for a Catalyst project so I knew the power of Selenium and decided to go with it as part of a toolkit for my test suite.  

</p><h3>Where has it ended?</h3>

<p>In the last week, I've been able to...</p>

<ul>
<li>Brush up on my Perl and 'NIX IPC skills only to wind up wrapping the Selenium RC (Java) server with some Perl for starting and stopping it based on a PID file</li>
<li>Make use of the <a href="http://selenium-rc.openqa.org/experimental.html">chrome experimental browser</a> to get around cross-site permission issues (<code>Permission denied to get property Location.href</code>)</li>
<li>Configure a crontab to autostart and run correctly in a virtual root, making it possible to automate the testing process and send the output of <code>prove</code> statements to myself on a periodic basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does Michael Phelps feel this good?</p>
