<p>Just got back from <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/396833/?ps=5">an evening with Tom Cochrane.</a>  I'll admit, I was going because I was under the impression that Brickhouse was still hosting Wii Wednesdays.  When I got there, there wasn't a Wii to be found but there were some people talking about modeling complex systems (read: space stations, space flight, missions to Mars, you know, things like that.)</p>  

<p>NASA's got some crazy smart people thinking about metamodeling. </p>

<p>Might have been even more entertaining than Wii Sports in the end.</p>
