I just helped a friend out by reviewing a site that he's now the Webmaster for and he thanked me for doing such a thorough job.&nbsp; I couldn't help but think of it like when I was young and working for my father.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever we pulled an orchard out, we had to prepare the field for whatever crop would come next.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Of course,&nbsp;with something like a cherry orchard,&nbsp;you can't just plant trees the next year, you have to let the field lie dormant for a&nbsp;while to recoup nutrients.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things you need to do before planting another crop is to "pick up rocks."&nbsp; What does that entail?&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;you need to have a tractor and trailer and at least three people:&nbsp; one to drive the tractor and the other two&nbsp;to literally pick&nbsp;up those rocks that&nbsp;are too big to be left in the field.&nbsp; What qualifies as too big? &nbsp;Anything you can get your hands around, that's for sure.&nbsp; Sometimes, as you're walking along, you see something that looks tiny.&nbsp; As you get closer, you get the feeling that it's bigger than you think so you start brushing dirt away from it.&nbsp; Often, something that looks like a paperweight turns out to be a&nbsp;big, unwieldy, forty-pound monster&nbsp;that you need to get help with and that's why it's good to at least try to turn over every stone.&nbsp;

In that same way, you can look at something on a website that looks like it's easy to change from a structure perspective but as you more closely examine it, you see that changing it will have broader consequences than you realized.&nbsp; Even still, it's wise to "leave no stone unturned" regarding the information structure of a website in order to&nbsp;explore how better to serve your audience.
