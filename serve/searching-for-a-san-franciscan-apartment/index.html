<p>Today I focused my energies on Russian Hill.  Around 10 this morning, I ventured out with my laptop in-tow in search of a great apartment.  I had already mapped out one and made an appointment to see it but I thought I should bring my laptop with so that I could find a cafe and research there.</p>

<p>A long story short, I saw three different apartments today in about the same part of town (although "the same part of town" is used loosely here) and at the end of the day, I realized that I should have just taken the first one I saw.</p>

<p>The first one was nice.  Great location, nice size, good price.  It wasn't until I walked around the neighborhood a little bit later in the day that I realized just how great the place is.  Today was the first day that it was on the market.  The previous renter just moved out yesterday.  I've got the application form filled out ready to hand in tomorrow morning.  I hope it didn't go already today; you never know.  Maybe I should have paid more attention to <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2006/07/how-to-find-an-apartment-in-san-francisco/">this</a></p>
