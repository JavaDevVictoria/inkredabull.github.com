Yesterday I <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/01/microsoft_takes_email_design_b.html">read</a> that the coming Outlook doesn't support a lot of best practices in HTML design for emails.  

Today, I see that Google has a pretty nifty <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/documentation/examples/desktopclone/demo.html">tool</a> as a demo which looks like it's not too far from what I'd seen of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/">Ximian's Evolution</a> before <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html">Novell</a> bought it.  

How much longer before Google announces it's Outlook killer?
