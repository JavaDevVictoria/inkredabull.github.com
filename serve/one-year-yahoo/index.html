Today I celebrate one year at Yahoo!  It's hard to believe that it's  
gone so fast.   In the last year, I've grown so much as a web  
developer and so much has happened at Yahoo; not the least of which  
being the Microsoft bid which we thankfully have behind us.

When I think about how I've grown, I'm so much faster in engineering  
software partly thanks to Catalyst, my knowledge of SOA and AJAX is so  
much better, my MySQL chops have advanced, and my code is more robust  
thanks to Selenium. Of course, I have to give credit to my teammates  
for assisting me in the process. When you're surrounded by top talent  
and have mammoth challenges, you rise to your potential.
