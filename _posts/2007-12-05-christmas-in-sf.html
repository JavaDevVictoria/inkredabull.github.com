<p>There are Christmas trees everywhere here in the city now.  When I saw them yesterday, I had to think "isn't it too soon to be buying a tree?"</p><p>Then, I remembered "it's Dec 4th! Only three more weeks until Christmas!"  That got me to thinking: except for one Christmas in my life, I've always been someplace cold in December.  The one time I wasn't, we (my family) were on vacation.</p>  <p>The novelty and anticipation of traveling and the fact that when we left Michigan and also arrived back, it was cold, lent a feeling of "it's a holiday." Here, it's so easy to forget that it's "winter."  </p>
