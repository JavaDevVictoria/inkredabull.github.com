<p>Methinks I have an idea for a widget...</p>

<p>Everybody know about the Flickr badge for Wordpress but no one seems to have developed a widget that will just display a random photo from your Flickr photostream.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for an update...</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Just put together a little code to do the trick.  Check it out <a href="http://www.thebullog.net/?page_id=205">here.</a></p>
