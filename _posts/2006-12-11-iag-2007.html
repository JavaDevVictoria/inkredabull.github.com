Just found out that the <a href="http://www.interagencygames.org/">Inter-Agency Games</a> - the UN's mini-olympics - will be held in Tyrol, Austria this year.  I had the privilege of participating in <a href="http://www.who.int/about/iag2005/en/">Crete</a> two years ago on the IAEA basketball team and was lucky enough to bring home two medals: the bronze and the silver!  I was "borrowed" to the Geneva/Paris/Rome team (consisting of staff members from WHO/FAO/etc.) which wasn't quite large enough to compete but we came in third, hence the bronze.  The IAEA team came in second, hence the silver.
